# Checking-Currency-Rates
Software Design Project

Description: 
In this assignment we will come up with initial design for the program. 
We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only looking at some initial design ideas.

Problem Statement: 
------------------
A Currency broker company has asked us to build a system that notifies them when a currency pair rate reaches the target rate. User configures the currency pair and target rate.

The URL to get the Rates in XML form: "http://rates.fxcm.com/RatesXML"

Example of the rate: 
<Rate Symbol="EURUSD">
<Bid>1.38022</Bid>
<Ask>1.38042</Ask>
<High>1.38266</High>
<Low>1.37634</Low>
<Direction>0</Direction>
<Last>10:42:43</Last>
</Rate>

Here "Bid" is the current rate. "Ask" is the suggested sell rate. "High" is day high, "Low" is day low, "Direction" is 1=>up, -1=>down, 0=>no change compared to last rate, and "Last" is the time for last tick.
